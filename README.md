The goal of simMed is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of simMed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cameronmccann/simMed")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(simMed)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
